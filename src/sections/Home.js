It is difficult to manage these ornamental plants and keep track of them. Their count is essential, especially in the selling season, and their quality has to be estimated sidewise continuously. Moreover, the impending labor shortage and higher wages, ultimately lead to higher plant prices and that, in turn, impacts the market.</h3>
